Instructions are encoded as a 4-bit opcode then a 12-bit operand, laid out in big-endian
 
0 add n -- add the value of register n to the accumulator
1 addi n -- add n to the accumulator
2 and n -- AND the accumulator with the value of register n
3 or n -- OR the accumulator with the value of register n
4 xor n -- XOR the accumulator with the value of register n
5 not -- NOT the accumulator
6 rot -- rotate the accumulator right by one bit
7 str n -- store the value of the accumulator to register n
8 ldr n -- load the value of the accumulator from register n
9 stm n -- store the value of the accumulator to address n
A ldm n -- load the value of the accumulator to address n
B li n -- load n to the accumulator
C jmp n -- do an unconditional jump to address n
D jz n -- jump to address n if the accumulator is zero
E jo n -- jump to address n if the overflow bit is set
F co -- clear the overflow bit
